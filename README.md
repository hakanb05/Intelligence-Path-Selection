# Intelligence-Path-Selection

This is the official repository for the honours project (12 EC) conducted at the University of Amsterdam, In collaboration with researcher Marios Avgeris, who will provide guidance and supervision throughout the project. Our project focuses on developing an intelligent path selection mechanism using Reinforcement Learning, specifically leveraging Stochastic Learning Automata (SLA) within a decentralized network.

We aim to implement our solution using **P4 software**, allowing for dynamic and efficient path selection. The final deliverable will include a research paper, limited to 5 pages, where we demonstrate the significance of our approach, address the shortcomings of previous methods, and showcase the improvements we have achieved.

This research contributes to the growing body of work in **network optimization** and **path selection**, aiming to provide more efficient, intelligent routing solutions for modern networks.
